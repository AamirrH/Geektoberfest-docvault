# Document Management System

A simple, open-source Document Management System built with FastAPI and React. This repository is intended as a beginner-friendly project for open-source contributions.

## 🌐 Live Demo

Try DocVault online:

- **Frontend:** https://doc-vault-lac.vercel.app
- **Backend API:** https://docvault-backend-iv5x.onrender.com
- **API Documentation:** https://docvault-backend-iv5x.onrender.com/docs

The frontend is deployed on Vercel, and the FastAPI backend is hosted on Render.

**Note:** The backend may take a little time to respond after a period of inactivity. Please allow a few seconds for it to wake up.



## Features

- **User Authentication:** Register and log in securely with JWT
- Upload and manage personal documents (up to 10MB)
- Documents and folders are completely private to the owner
- Download documents
- Delete documents
- Create and delete folders
- Search documents by filename
- Browse documents in pages of 10, with search and folder filters

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Alembic
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Axios

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- PostgreSQL

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DocVault.git
cd DocVault
```

### 2. Backend Setup

Configure PostgreSQL:
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running.
- Create a database (e.g., `document_manager`).

Set up Python environment and run:
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create .env file and set your DATABASE_URL
copy .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your PostgreSQL credentials

# Run database migrations to create tables
alembic upgrade head

# Start the application
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
The React application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Document pagination

The document list shows 10 documents per page, newest first. Use **Previous** and
**Next** below the table; the current page, matching document count, and page size
are displayed alongside them. Search and folder changes reset to page 1. Deleting
the last item on a page returns you to the last available page. Empty results show
"No documents found" and disable both navigation buttons.

The frontend uses `GET /documents/page` with `page` (default 1), `page_size`
(default 10, maximum 100), optional `q`, and optional `folder_id`. The authenticated
response contains `items`, `total`, `page`, `page_size`, and `total_pages`. Ownership,
search, and folder filters are applied before counting and pagination. Results are
ordered by creation time descending, then ID descending to break ties. Pages past
the end are clamped to the last available page; zero results return page 1 of 1
with an empty `items` array. Invalid page or page-size values return `422`.

The existing `/documents/` and `/documents/search` endpoints keep their array
responses for compatibility.

## Running tests

From `backend`, with your virtual environment activated:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Backend tests use an isolated in-memory SQLite database without modifying your
development database. From `frontend`:

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
```
