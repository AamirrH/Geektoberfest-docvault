# Document Management System

A simple, open-source Document Management System built with FastAPI and React. This repository is intended as a beginner-friendly project for open-source contributions.

## 🌐 Live Demo

Try DocVault online:

- **Frontend:** https://doc-vault-lac.vercel.app
- **Backend API:** https://docvault-backend-iv5x.onrender.com
- **API Documentation:** https://docvault-backend-iv5x.onrender.com/docs

The frontend is deployed on Vercel, and the FastAPI backend is hosted on Render.

**Note:** The backend may take a little time to respond after a period of inactivity. Please allow a few seconds for it to wake up.



## Features

- **User Authentication:** Register and log in securely with JWT
- Upload and manage personal documents (up to 10MB)
- Documents and folders are completely private to the owner
- Download documents
- Delete documents
- Create and delete folders
- Rename folders with validation that preserves your input on errors
- Search documents by filename
- Browse documents in pages of 10, with search and folder filters

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Alembic
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Axios

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- PostgreSQL

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DocVault.git
cd DocVault
```

### 2. Backend Setup

Configure PostgreSQL:
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running.
- Create a database (e.g., `document_manager`).

Set up Python environment and run:
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create .env file and set your DATABASE_URL
copy .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your PostgreSQL credentials

# Run database migrations to create tables
alembic upgrade head

# Start the application
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
The React application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Document pagination

The document list shows 10 documents per page, newest first. Use **Previous** and
**Next** below the table; the current page, matching document count, and page size
are displayed alongside them. Search, folder, and file-type changes reset to page 1. Deleting
the last item on a page returns you to the last available page. Empty results show
helpful empty-state guidance and disable both navigation buttons.

The frontend uses `GET /documents/page` with `page` (default 1), `page_size`
(default 10, maximum 100), and optional `q`, `folder_id`, and `file_type`. The authenticated
response contains `items`, `total`, `page`, `page_size`, and `total_pages`. Ownership,
search, folder, and file-type filters are applied before counting and pagination. Results are
ordered by creation time descending, then ID descending to break ties. Pages past
the end are clamped to the last available page; zero results return page 1 of 1
with an empty `items` array. Invalid page or page-size values return `422`.

The existing `/documents/` and `/documents/search` endpoints keep their array
responses for compatibility.

## Folder names

Folder creation and renaming trim leading and trailing whitespace and reject empty
or whitespace-only names. Names must be unique for each user (case-sensitive).
Folders are currently a flat list, so there is no parent-folder scope. Different
users can use the same folder name.

Use the pencil button beside a folder to rename it, then choose **Save** or
**Cancel**. Validation errors appear beside the input without clearing your text.
Renaming keeps the folder's documents and current selection unchanged.

The API accepts `PATCH /folders/{folder_id}` with `{"name": "New name"}` and requires
authentication as the folder owner. Invalid names return `422`, duplicate names
return `400`, and missing folders or folders owned by another user return `404`.

## Running tests

From `backend`, with your virtual environment activated:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Backend tests use an isolated in-memory SQLite database and do not require a
running PostgreSQL instance or modify your development database.

From `frontend`:

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
```
